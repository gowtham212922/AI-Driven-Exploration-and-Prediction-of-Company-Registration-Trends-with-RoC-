## Overview
This project explores the problem of predicting trends in company registration using AI techniques. It uses data from the (RoC) to build predictive models and gain insights into registration trends. The project includes data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

## Requirements
Make sure you have the following dependencies installed:
- Python 3.7+
- Jupyter Notebook (optional but recommended for data exploration)
- [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
- [Scikit-Learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
- [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)
- [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/)


## Installation

Open your jupyter notebook or Other IDE and run code using our documentation

## Usage

- Run the Jupyter Notebook to explore and preprocess the program from Phase 5 documentation
- Including Read a dataset , Analyze the data like head(),tail(),info(),describe() etc..
- Run code Feature Engineering , Exploratory Data analysis
- Train the AI model to predict company registration trends

## Data
The project uses data from the (RoC) for company registration trends. You can download [Click Here](https://tn.data.gov.in/resource/company-master-data-tamil-nadu-upto-28th-february-2019)
